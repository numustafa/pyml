How I setup my python Enviroment?


For IDE, I installed VScode on my Windows 11 system. Then relevent extentions I installed in VS code were Python, Jupyter and Live share. In order to setup my IDE with Python, I decided to go with miniconda distribution. With miniconda, it is easier to create multiple enviroments with specific Python version & Libraries. My Python enviroment contains Python 3.9 & course relevent Libraries. 

Complete guide for installing & using conda distribution is given here: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html.
